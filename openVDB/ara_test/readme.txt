This folder is to test the OpenVDB build.  

1.  Run downloadVDBFile.bat.  It downloads a zipped vdb file from the OpenVDB website.
2.  Unzip the vdb zip file into this folder.  The file unzipped is icosahedron.vdb.  If you download another vdb file, you will have to update the runTest.bat file with the new name.
3.  Run runTest.bat.  runTest.bat executes the vdb_print.exe and if sucessful, it will print out the details of the vdb file.
